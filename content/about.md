## Schooling

I am currently a Junior at the University of Notre Dame, with a double major in computer science and math. 
I have been lucky to known I wanted a career in computer science since nearly 8th grade, but my additional math major is purely out
of intense love for the subject!

```python
class Tommy():
  
  __init__(self):
    self.age = 20
    self.year = "Junior"
    self.majors = ["CS", "Math"]
    self.interests = ["Hiking", "Fishing", "Woodworking", "Lord of the Rings"]
```

This year I'm looking forward to being studying abroad at the *Budapest Semester In Mathematics* program. For one, I am Hungarian on both sides of my family, so I am excited to learn the language and culture. Second, the professors who will be teaching me are some of the best (a few have even written the textbooks that I've used for past subjects), and I expect to learn a ton. Additionally, I'm excited to be involved with a research team studying *homomorphic encryption* and creating practical implimentations of it.

Some things I'm currently interested in:
> - Quantum Computing
> - Cryptography
> - Diffusion Models
> - Blockchain
