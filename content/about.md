## Schooling

I am currently a Junior at the University of Notre Dame, with a double major in computer science and math. 
I have been lucky to known I wanted a career in computer science since nearly 8th grade, but my additional math major is purely out
of intense love for the subject!

```python
class Tommy():
  
  __init__(self):
    self.age = 20
    self.year = "Junior"
    self.majors = ["CS", "Math"]
    self.interests = ["Hiking", "Fishing", "Woodworking", "Lord of the Rings"]
```

This semester I'm looking forward to being a teaching assistant for the *Discrete Math* course. I've always wanted to spend some time teaching when I'm older, so this could be a nice introduction to that. Additionally, I'm excited to be involved with a research team studying *homomorphic encryption* and creating practical implimentations of it.

Some things I'm currently interested in:
> - Quantum Computing
> - Cryptography
> - Diffusion Models
> - Blockchain
