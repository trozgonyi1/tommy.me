# Hackers in the bazaar

This are my reflections for the ND computer science elective "Hackers in the bazaar", taught by Prof. Bui.
The first book we are reading is "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution", by Steven Levy.

## Reflection 1: True Hackers

The idea of a true hacker is the main focus of the first few chapters of the book. It is shown through many examples that hackers are those who feel a need to learn through building and tinkering with whatever they may be interested in, regardless of rules or boundaries. The idea of a hacker is built on the thesis that all information and tools to obtain information should be open and free to access.

An example of this mentality is the Midnight Requisitioning Committee. This was a subgroup of the Tech Model Railroad Club who would go out at night and steal the supplies they needed. All this was justified with the idea that they needed these supplies for learning and therefore they should be available to them. This highlights the moral stance of the hacker ethic which favors the independent, “decentralized” hacker, rather than big organizations like MIT or IBM. The TMRC could justify their behavior with the idea that _“All information should be free”_ and _“Mistrust authority–Promote Decentralization.”_

This is especially shown with the way the TMRC views IBM. They describe the company as overly bureaucratic and full of “batch-processed people” who could never understand the value in a decentralized system. While the hacker ethic does an excellent job promoting learning and development of technological art and innovation, I find it has a tendency to undervalue the importance of organizations such as IBM. All the machinery that the Tech Model Railroad Club was so fascinated with was produced by one of these bureaucratic, centralized organizations. This is shown by the clear disapproval of both IBM and NASA by members of the TMRC. Even though IBM was a company which worked on some of the most advanced computing technology of the time, their workers were looked down upon by the club and almost discredited as scientists. A similar thing happened with NASA. One member of the AI Lab is characterized by saying he “...had disdained NASA’s humanwave approach toward things.” Ultimately, it becomes clear from NASA’s success that there are methods other than the Hacker Ethic that can yield incredible results. In fact, it seems that oftentimes the Hacker Ethic promotes learning and cool “art”-style tech projects, but fails to bring about large-scale, advanced community projects—things that require some degree of bureaucracy and organization.

The portrayal of a “true hacker” in this book certainly differs from my view of the modern hacker. Aside from the obvious differences between the book’s hacker and the Hollywood hacker, I think the book highlights a clear culture shift in the tech world over the last 60–70 years. The modern student of computer science participates in organized hackathons led by large companies, dreams of landing a FAANG job and making lots of money while only working 6 hours a day. Steven Levy’s hacker is someone who seeks out projects independently, and works on them only for the goals of learning and building something cool. There was no idea of working on something to display on GitHub or bolster your résumé. Hacks were pursued out of passion and a desire to learn.

The new culture in tech isn’t all bad. It has led to a much more welcoming environment where the barrier to entry is low. More people have access to more information and a larger community than ever before. Unfortunately, I believe that this has somewhat diluted the passion that used to be present. Since information is so much easier to get, there are far fewer cases of people going to the lengths we see the TMRC go to. The result of this is a loss in the learning that comes from aimlessly tinkering or even just trying to understand a system with little guidance.

I think this 1950s idea of the “true hacker” is an excellent guideline of how passionate we should be for something if we really care about understanding it fully. Rather than focusing on how we can use LLMs to extract the maximum value out of the job market or put together a startup with enough buzzwords to get into YC, a return to Levy’s hacker ideology would reignite a passion in the tech world that has somewhat diminished.

## Reflection 2: Hardware Hackers

At the heart of hacking there are a few certain qualities that are necessary to be a skilled, effective hacker; tech curiosity and being comfortable engaging with things they don’t (yet) understand. The “True Hackers” and “Hardware Hackers” both showed these qualities. They were happy to dive into complex systems that seemed intimidating and demystify it through the “hands-on imperative”. Where they differ is in what they believe technology should be used for and who the right people to use it were. The true hackers had a bit of an elite-ism view to their work. While it is true they were accepting to any hackers, they looked down on those they didn’t consider to be hackers. This grew tensions between them and the “Hardware Hackers” who wanted to bring computers to the general person. This mentality still persists today to some extent. People in tech (and STEM fields in general) tend to have a superiority complex and view themselves as smarter than other fields. I think most ND CS majors, including myself, have made fun of Mendoza majors in playful conversation. Part of the hacker culture is one of pride, which can be good when it is used as motivation for projects, but can be harmful when egos get too inflated.

Building and selling personal computers was a huge step in breaking down the elitist mentality amongst hackers. By giving regular people access to this equipment, they pushed the hacker ethic farther than the “true hackers” were willing to take it. We see now, ~50 years later, CS classes are filled with more “Mendoza type” students than ever before. People who might not have been drawn to CS if it kept the culture, it once had. Financial motives have also been a big driver of this and a large source of tension. On one hand, commercialization made computers more widely available. On the other hand, it introduced values that clashed with openness and sharing such as, secrecy, and competition. We have certainly seen some dangerous effects of this such as predatory tactics in social media to keep us addicted to our phones, and Orwellian data surveillance on a global scale, but we have also seen an historic rise in the ability to connect with others, help the less fortunate, and a general improvement in the base quality of life. I think it is very interesting to examine the political background in cases like Lee Felsenstein and how that may have influenced his view of the hacker ethic. We see all over the world technology being used as a tool for liberation like Lee hoped it would be, with projects that give access to literature that is banned in certain countries, or free classes to people who otherwise would not be able to access them. Unfortunately, with this comes cases like the CCP, where citizens are watched constantly and their freedoms have been largely stripped away. Like any other tool, it comes down to how the user choses to act. Ultimately, I believe in Lee’s view of technology as a tool for liberation more so than Efrem Lipkin’s view of it as a tool for oppression. While it hasn’t all been good, the general quality of life for the average human has improved, I believe in part to technology brought about by the hacker ethic.
