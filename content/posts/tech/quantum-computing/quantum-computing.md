## IBM Certification

In January of 2023 I earned an IBM Certification as a quantum computing developer. This was the start of my obsession with quantum computing. 
For the certification I learned about the basics:
> - What is a Qubit?
> - Entanglement
> - Quantum Gates
> - Pauli States

All the way up to some more advanced concepts:

> - Quantum Teleportation / Superdense Coding
> - Deutch-Jozsa Algorithm
> - Simmon's Algorithm

This certification required a great deal of self study, as this is not a topic I've yet encountered in school. I had to do a good deal of 
research, and a lot of prep for the exam. I am a strong believer in learning outside the classroom, so this was enjoyable for me!

## `Quantum Computing For Everyone`

This is the first book I read about QC. It provides a great introduction to all the foundational ideas.

`Pros`

1. This book assumes you have only a foundational background in CS and Math. It explains the linear algebra used (albeit at a very surface level),
and all of the coding concepts used
1. It is very well written and easy to read. I found myself enjoying the book and not having a trouble finding time to read.
1. Nothing is glossed over. All the basic concepts that are vital to understanding the harder ones are explained in depth.

`Cons`

1. The author chooses to work only in ℝ, rather than ℂ. This is a useful simplification for people hoping to encounter simpler math, but does
cause some loss of accuracy to the subject.
1. The portion of the book introducing quantum algorithms is a bit shorter and less detailed than the rest.

**Overall**, this book is a great introduction to quantum computing, and I would recommend it to anyone.

## `Dancing With Qubits`

I am currently reading this book, and enjoying it. Here are my thoughts so far:

This book is a much deeper dive into the details of QC. The math is more complicated and the ideas taught are more relevant to real world 
problems and applications. *updates to follow...*
