Freshman year **done**! It seems like yesterday I was meeting my roommate and starting my first college courses.
Looking back, I'm more than pleased with how it went. Between classes, friends, and extracurriculars I was busy
24/7.

# Fall Semester

## Courses

First semester I was taking mostly core requirements. I usually enjoy these less than my major courses, but I of course
see the value in being a well rounded student.

> - Calc 3 
> - God and the Good Life 
> - Irish Poetry 
> - Engineering Design
> - Chem

As expected, I enjoyed calc 3 as I have most of my math courses. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I both enjoyed, and 
learned from my Irish Poetry course. I am not an avid writer, and have certainly never excelled at writing papers. During this
course, however, my professor was able to get me interested in the material enough to put forward maximal effort. He offered
me a ton of help, always willing to sit down with me and help with my papers.

# Spring Semester

Spring semester was when I really got to explore the CS and math curriculum. I found all my professors to be excellent,
always offering office hours and ready to help. This semester I also was on a research team, studying how AI can be used 
to offer equity to Uber drivers. I learned about how the rideshare algorithms are unfair to the drivers, and we designed 
and tested solutions.

## Courses

> - Linear Algebra (Proofs based)
> - Fundamentals of Computing
> - Discrete Mathematics
> - History of the Modern Middle East
> - Physics 1 

Linear algebra and discrete math were my favorites. In linear, we took each topic in depth from a proofs based point of view.
It definantly challenged me, as it was my first proofs focused course. That being said, I really enjoyed the rigor and look 
forward to more courses like it. Discrete math was the perfect ballance between math and CS. I loved writing proofs that 
were highly applicable to CS concepts. I'm super excited to be a TA for this course next semester.
