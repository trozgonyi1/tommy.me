Sophomore year **done**! It is crazy to think that I am already halfway through my college career.
I had the priviledge to take more advanced courses, live with 5 of my best friends, and act as a teaching assistant.
All in all, this year helped me grow both as a student and an individual.

# Fall Semester

## Courses

Fall semester introduced me to courses that really began to get into aspects of my majors that excited me. Cryptography and Data Structures were taught by excellent professors, and while they were difficult, led me to learning a ton. My cryptography professor played a role in getting me super interested in the field, and it has been something I have self studied since.

> - Data Structures
> - Differential Equations
> - Cryptography
> - Logic Design
> - Intro to Mathematical Reasoning

Intro to Math Reasoning was very similar to Discrete Math, and was thus a little boring, although great practice to reinforce my proof skills. While differential equations was interesting, I definitely prefer proofs based courses. Finally, Logic Design was refreshing as it got me away from the software side of CS and introduced me to the extremely low level, which was new to me.

# Spring Semester

Spring semester I did a lot of math. A LOT of math. That being said, I really enjoyed it. My only CS course, Systems Programming, was by far my favorite so far. Taught by an amazing professor, I thought that the understanding I gained of such fundamental concepts was incredible. I believe I have become a much stronger programmer just from this course. I spent time in a one-on-one directed readings course studying quantum computing algorithms. My advisor taught me the hard work and frustration that goes into reading formal mathematics papers. This was a very valuable experience and I really enjoyed studying Shor's and Grover's Algorithms.
