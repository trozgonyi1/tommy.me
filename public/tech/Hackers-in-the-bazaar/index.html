The first book we are reading is “Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution”, by Steven Levy.\nReflection 1: True Hackers The idea of a true hacker is the main focus of the first few chapters of the book. It is shown through many examples that hackers are those who feel a need to learn through building and tinkering with whatever they may be interested in, regardless of rules or boundaries. The idea of a hacker is built on the thesis that all information and tools to obtain information should be open and free to access.\nAn example of this mentality is the Midnight Requisitioning Committee. This was a subgroup of the Tech Model Railroad Club who would go out at night and steal the supplies they needed. All this was justified with the idea that they needed these supplies for learning and therefore they should be available to them. This highlights the moral stance of the hacker ethic which favors the independent, “decentralized” hacker, rather than big organizations like MIT or IBM. The TMRC could justify their behavior with the idea that “All information should be free” and “Mistrust authority–Promote Decentralization.”\nThis is especially shown with the way the TMRC views IBM. They describe the company as overly bureaucratic and full of “batch-processed people” who could never understand the value in a decentralized system. While the hacker ethic does an excellent job promoting learning and development of technological art and innovation, I find it has a tendency to undervalue the importance of organizations such as IBM. All the machinery that the Tech Model Railroad Club was so fascinated with was produced by one of these bureaucratic, centralized organizations. This is shown by the clear disapproval of both IBM and NASA by members of the TMRC. Even though IBM was a company which worked on some of the most advanced computing technology of the time, their workers were looked down upon by the club and almost discredited as scientists. A similar thing happened with NASA. One member of the AI Lab is characterized by saying he “…had disdained NASA’s humanwave approach toward things.” Ultimately, it becomes clear from NASA’s success that there are methods other than the Hacker Ethic that can yield incredible results. In fact, it seems that oftentimes the Hacker Ethic promotes learning and cool “art”-style tech projects, but fails to bring about large-scale, advanced community projects—things that require some degree of bureaucracy and organization.\nThe portrayal of a “true hacker” in this book certainly differs from my view of the modern hacker. Aside from the obvious differences between the book’s hacker and the Hollywood hacker, I think the book highlights a clear culture shift in the tech world over the last 60–70 years. The modern student of computer science participates in organized hackathons led by large companies, dreams of landing a FAANG job and making lots of money while only working 6 hours a day. Steven Levy’s hacker is someone who seeks out projects independently, and works on them only for the goals of learning and building something cool. There was no idea of working on something to display on GitHub or bolster your résumé. Hacks were pursued out of passion and a desire to learn.\nThe new culture in tech isn’t all bad. It has led to a much more welcoming environment where the barrier to entry is low. More people have access to more information and a larger community than ever before. Unfortunately, I believe that this has somewhat diluted the passion that used to be present. Since information is so much easier to get, there are far fewer cases of people going to the lengths we see the TMRC go to. The result of this is a loss in the learning that comes from aimlessly tinkering or even just trying to understand a system with little guidance.\nI think this 1950s idea of the “true hacker” is an excellent guideline of how passionate we should be for something if we really care about understanding it fully. Rather than focusing on how we can use LLMs to extract the maximum value out of the job market or put together a startup with enough buzzwords to get into YC, a return to Levy’s hacker ideology would reignite a passion in the tech world that has somewhat diminished.\n","wordCount":"742","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/posts/tech/hackers/pictures/hackers.jpg","datePublished":"2025-08-31T10:00:25-04:00","dateModified":"2025-08-31T10:00:25-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tommy Rozgonyi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/tech/Hackers-in-the-bazaar/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"tommy.me","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/ accesskey=h title="tommy.me (Alt + H)">tommy.me</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/posts/tech/ title=tech><span>tech</span></a></li><li><a href=https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/posts/life/ title=life><span>life</span></a></li><li><a href=https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/archives/ title=archive><span>archive</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/posts/tech/>tech</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Hackers in the bazaar</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-08-31 10:00:25 -0400 EDT'>August 31, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Tommy Rozgonyi</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><a href=https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/posts/tech/hackers/pictures/hackers.jpg target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading=eager src=https://trozgonyi1.github.io/tommy.me/posts/tech/hackers/pictures/hackers.jpg alt="Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution"></a></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#hackers-in-the-bazaar aria-label="Hackers in the bazaar">Hackers in the bazaar</a><ul><li><a href=#reflection-1-true-hackers aria-label="Reflection 1: True Hackers">Reflection 1: True Hackers</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h1 id=hackers-in-the-bazaar>Hackers in the bazaar<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hackers-in-the-bazaar>#</a></h1><p>This are my reflections for the ND computer science elective &ldquo;Hackers in the bazaar&rdquo;, taught by Prof. Bui.
